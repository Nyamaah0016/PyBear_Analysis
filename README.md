
To analyse the data for a ride-sharing organization based on the city type (Rural, Suburban and Urban). Post analyzing the data share 3 key observations which can help the organization in making data backed decision

## Top 3 Observations :
- Maximum ride count and riders are from urban cities
- On analyzing the data of fare per rider, we can see that though maximum count of rides are from urban cities but average fare per rider is least among all the three city type
- As per the data, not every rider gets a ride in urban cities as the number of riders are too many

## Summary :
- Number of riders in urban should be reduced temporarily as it will increase the net income
- We need to gather information around the number of rides being cancelled in suburban and rural cities due to unavailability of the riders and then number of riders should be increased accordingly
- Weekly analysis of the data should be done rigorously to help understanding the pattern based on the month, seasion and region. This is important for a good pricing strategy
